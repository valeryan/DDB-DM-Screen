# DDB DM Screen
This Tampermonkey userscript that enhances the campaign page on dndbeyond.com. It adds extra character data to the character cards to function like a DM screen.

## Usage

1. Install Tampermonkey addon for managing userscripts. Get [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
2. Install new script from below link: https://valeryan.github.io/DDB-DM-Screen/ddb-dm-screen.user.js
3. Open your campaign, can be found here https://dndbeyond.com/my-campaigns
4. When a release is published it will be automatically published to the github page and should prompt to update the installed script.

## Features
1. Uses publicly accessible API endpoints and a tool called Simplified Character Data System(SCDS) to display extra information about characters on your campaign screen.

## Security

Remember to never paste unknown userscripts from some shady github repos to your tampermonkey addon as this can severely compromise your PC.

## Note about other DM Screen Scripts
There are several such user scripts around and some Chrome extensions, etc. I draw inspiration from all these.
